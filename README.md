# Samsara Architecture

I’m a software developer with aspirations to become a software architect. I decided that the best way to learn is to do. This is my [Second Brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) project.

## What is a Second Brain anyway?

[Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) is the practise of collecting information and storing it in a way that is accessible and timeous. There are a few notable practitioners worth mentioning.

[Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) wrote prolifically, with more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles published on a variety of subjects, including law, economy, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. He used a system called [Zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

Sönke Ahrens, Author of the book "[How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes)", took the idea and ran with it. Tiago Forte had the following to say about it [in his book summary](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/):

> It is by far the most impactful and profound book I’ve ever read on the subject. I was astounded to encounter in its pages (with uncanny similarity) many of the same principles I had discovered over 10 years of personal experience.
> 
> This book is so full of insights that it broke my usual approach to summarizing books.

Tiago runs a course called [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/). His system for storing is called [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/). I quite like [Maggie Appelton's Illustrated Notes](https://maggieappleton.com/basb).
